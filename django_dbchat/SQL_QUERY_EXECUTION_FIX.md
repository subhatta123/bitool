# SQL Query Execution Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Query execution was failing with the error:
```
Binder Error: No function matches the given name and argument types 'sum(STRUCT(...))'
```

The root cause was that the SQL adaptation logic was incorrectly replacing column names with table names inside SQL functions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Problem
When the LLM generated this SQL:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(Order_Date) as year, SUM(Sales) as total_sales FROM sales WHERE Segment = 'Consumer'
```

The system's table name replacement logic was doing a broad replacement:
- It correctly identified `sales` after `FROM` as a table name
- But it also incorrectly replaced `Sales` in `SUM(Sales)` with the full table name
- This resulted in: `SUM(source_id_49bc6f61_b37a_4800_9acf_7ee29d77ce45)` 
- DuckDB tried to sum the entire table structure instead of the Sales column

### The Failing Query
```sql
SELECT YEAR(STRPTIME("Order_Date", '%d-%m-%Y')) as year, 
       SUM(source_id_49bc6f61_b37a_4800_9acf_7ee29d77ce45) as total_sales 
FROM source_id_49bc6f61_b37a_4800_9acf_7ee29d77ce45 
WHERE "Segment" = 'Consumer' 
GROUP BY YEAR(STRPTIME("Order_Date", '%d-%m-%Y')) 
ORDER BY year;
```

## Solution Implemented

### Context-Aware Table Name Replacement
Modified `_adapt_query_with_better_mapping()` in `services/data_service.py` to replace table names only in specific SQL contexts:

1. **After FROM** - `FROM sales` → `FROM actual_table_name`
2. **After JOIN** - `JOIN sales` → `JOIN actual_table_name` 
3. **After UPDATE** - `UPDATE sales` → `UPDATE actual_table_name`
4. **After INTO** - `INTO sales` → `INTO actual_table_name`

### Key Improvements
- **Preserved Column References**: `SUM(Sales)`, `COUNT(Sales)`, `AVG(Sales)` remain unchanged
- **Context-Specific Replacement**: Only table names in table contexts are replaced
- **Regex Patterns**: Uses precise regex with negative lookahead to avoid function contexts

### Fixed Query Result
```sql
SELECT YEAR(STRPTIME("Order_Date", '%d-%m-%Y')) as year, 
       SUM("Sales") as total_sales 
FROM source_id_49bc6f61_b37a_4800_9acf_7ee29d77ce45 
WHERE "Segment" = 'Consumer' 
GROUP BY YEAR(STRPTIME("Order_Date", '%d-%m-%Y')) 
ORDER BY year;
```

## Test Results
✅ `SUM(Sales)` preserved correctly (column reference)  
✅ `FROM sales` replaced correctly (table reference)  
✅ All SQL function column references maintained  
✅ Table names in proper contexts replaced accurately  

## Impact
- **Query Execution**: Fixes the immediate "sum(STRUCT)" error
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents incorrect aggregation of entire table structures  
- **User Experience**: Enables proper year-over-year comparison queries
- **System Reliability**: Prevents similar column/table name confusion in future queries

## Files Modified
- `django_dbchat/services/data_service.py` - Enhanced `_adapt_query_with_better_mapping()` method

## Testing
The fix was verified with test cases covering:
- Basic SUM/COUNT/AVG functions with column preservation
- Table name replacement in FROM/JOIN/UPDATE/INTO contexts
- Mixed scenarios with both column and table references

This fix ensures that SQL adaptation preserves the semantic meaning of queries while correctly mapping logical table names to physical database table names.
