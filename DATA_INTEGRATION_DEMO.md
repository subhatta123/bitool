## 📋 **Step-by-Step Demo Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Data Source Setup**
1. **Navigate to "Data Integration & ETL"** from the sidebar
2. **Upload Sample Data**:
   - Upload `customers.csv` (customer_id, name, email, city)
   - Upload `orders.csv` (order_id, customer_id, product, amount, date)
   - Upload `products.csv` (product_id, product_name, category, price)

### **Phase 2: AI Relationship Discovery**
3. **View AI Suggestions** in the "AI Suggested Joins" tab:
   ```
   🔗 customers ↔ orders (Confidence: 95%)
   Relationship: Join customers.customer_id with orders.customer_id
   Join Type: LEFT JOIN
   
   🔗 orders ↔ products (Confidence: 87%)
   Relationship: Join orders.product with products.product_name
   Join Type: INNER JOIN
   ```

### **Phase 3: ETL Pipeline Creation**
4. **Create Join Operations**:
   - Click "Create ETL Join" for customer-orders relationship
   - Manually create product joins in "ETL Operations" tab
   - View generated SQL: 
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM source_csv_1_20231201_143022 t1
     LEFT JOIN source_csv_2_20231201_143045 t2
     ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
     ```

### **Phase 4: Enhanced Querying**
5. **Ask Cross-Source Questions**:
   ```
   "What is the total revenue by customer city?"
   "Which products are most popular in each region?"
   "Show me customers who haven't placed orders this month"
   ```

6. **AI Processing**:
   - AI detects multi-source requirement
   - Suggests necessary joins automatically
   - Executes ETL pipeline
   - Returns integrated results

### **Phase 5: Dashboard Integration**
7. **Create Rich Dashboards**:
   - Use integrated data for visualizations
   - Create KPIs from joined datasets
   - Build cross-source analytics
   - Share insights via email with images

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Integration Engine**
```python
# Core Components
DataSource(id, name, type, schema, status)
DataRelationship(source1, source2, confidence, join_type)
ETLOperation(id, operation_type, sql_query, output_table)
```

### **AI Analysis Pipeline**
1. **Schema Analysis**: Column types, patterns, uniqueness
2. **Relationship Detection**: Name similarity, data compatibility
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted algorithm for join suggestions
4. **Query Intent Analysis**: Multi-source requirement detection

### **SQLite Integration Layer**
- **In-Memory Database**: All sources loaded into integrated SQLite
- **Table Naming**: `source_{source_id}` format
- **ETL Output**: `etl_output_{operation_id}` format
- **Cross-Source Queries**: Native SQL JOIN operations

---

## 🎯 **Example Use Cases**

### **E-commerce Analytics**
```
Data Sources: customers.csv + orders.csv + products.csv
Query: "Revenue by customer segment and product category"
AI Process: Detects need for triple join → Executes ETL → Returns analysis
```

### **Sales Reporting**
```
Data Sources: CRM database + Sales API + Product catalog CSV
Query: "Top performing sales reps by region and product line"
AI Process: Multi-source join → Aggregation → Dashboard visualization
```

### **Financial Analysis**
```
Data Sources: Transactions DB + Customer API + Market data CSV
Query: "Customer lifetime value by acquisition channel"
AI Process: Complex joins → Time-series analysis → KPI creation
```
